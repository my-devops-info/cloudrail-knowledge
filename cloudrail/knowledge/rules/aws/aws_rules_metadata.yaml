templates:
  - public_access_security_groups_port_rule_name_template: Ensure no used security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port {} ({})
  - public_access_security_groups_port_rule_description_template: Exposing resources to the Internet is generally inadvisable, especially on a known port like {} ({}).
  - public_access_security_groups_port_rule_logic_template: Cloudrail will identify all security groups in use. For each one, it will determine if it has {} ({}) exposed to 0.0.0.0/0.
      Then, it will identify where the security group is in use. If it's not in use, the security group will be ignored.
      For each resource the security group is used with, Cloudrail will determine the subnet it is located in.
      It will then review the routing table to verify that the subnet is accessible from the Internet, and that the NACL associated with the subnet has the aforementioned port open.
      This ensures the security group is only flagged if there's a real exposure.
  - public_access_security_groups_port_rule_remediation_steps_console: Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#updating-security-group-rules>
      to update the security group inbound rule. Set the Source parameter to a value other than 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 for the {} port.
  - public_access_security_groups_port_rule_remediation_steps_tf: For the resource aws_security_group, update in-line ingress rules or resource aws_security_group_rule to set cidr_blocks argument to a value other than 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0
      for the {} port.
  - vpc_endpoint_gateway_is_not_used_rule_name_template: Ensure VPC Endpoint for {} is enabled in all VPCs
  - vpc_endpoint_gateway_is_not_used_rule_description_template: A best practice is to enforce the use of VPC Endpoints to avoid
      the need of sending data destined to {} through the internet.
  - vpc_endpoint_gateway_is_not_used_rule_human_readable_logic_template: Cloudrail will identify all {0} and the regions where they exist.
      For each region, it will check that there is a VPC Endpoint for {1} created and which VPC it's associated to,
      it will then check all VPCs to identify which ones are not associated to a VPC Endpoint for {1} and will
      flag it as non-compliant, also if there were no VPC Endpoints in the region but there was
      a {2} it will flag all VPCs as non-compliant.
      It will check that there is at least one resource using an ENI to avoid alerting on unused VPCs.
  - vpc_endpoint_gateway_is_not_used_rule_remediation_steps_console: Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-s3.html> to configure {} endpoint for the VPC.
  - vpc_endpoint_gateway_is_not_used_rule_remediation_steps_tf: Create the aws_vpc_endpoint resource for the corresponding VPC to associate the {} endpoint. Create the aws_vpc_endpoint_route_table_association resource
      in order to populate the route table with routes to the {} service.

  - vpc_endpoint_route_table_exposure_rule_name_template: Ensure VPC Endpoint for {} is enabled in all route tables in use in a VPC
  - vpc_endpoint_route_table_exposure_rule_description_template: A best practice is to enforce the use of VPC Endpoints to avoid the need of
      sending data destined to {} through the internet.
      Cloudrail will identify misconfigurations and exposure by checking if VPC Endpoint Gateways are in use or not,
      by reviewing VPC Endpoint and route tables in all regions.
  - vpc_endpoint_route_table_exposure_rule_human_readable_logic_template: Cloudrail will identify all {0} and
      the regions where they exist. For each region, it will check that there is a VPC Endpoint for {1} created,
      if so it will check which route tables it's associated to, it will then check all route tables to identify which
      ones are not associated to a VPC Endpoint for {1} and will flag them as non-compliant.
      It will check the routing tables in each VPC to avoid alerting on subnets that don't have internet access.
  - vpc_endpoint_route_table_exposure_rule_remediation_steps_console: Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-gateway.html#vpc-endpoints-routing> to configure the route tables
      to route {} service traffic via the endpoint.
  - vpc_endpoint_route_table_exposure_rule_remediation_steps_tf: For the aws_vpc_endpoint_route_table_association resource, set the route_table_id and vpc_endpoint_id arguments for the {} service.

  - policy_wildcard_violation_rule_name_template: Ensure use of {} policy, and no action wildcards are being used
  - policy_wildcard_violation_rule_description_template: Using wildcard actions may inadvertently allow users to take actions you do not want to allow them to do.
      In addition, using a resource policy will provide an additional layer of security.
      It is a best practice to use a resource policy and give specific permissions only.
  - policy_wildcard_violation_rule_human_readable_logic_template: Cloudrail will review the {} policies being created in your environment or currently in use.
      If a policy is using wildcard actions, or no resource policy configured, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation.
  - policy_wildcard_violation_rule_remediation_steps_console: Follow the guide at {} to modify {} policy in order to avoid using wildcard actions.
  - policy_wildcard_violation_rule_remediation_steps_tf: For the {} resource, modify policy argument in order to avoid using wildcard actions.

  - iam_account_password_policy_rule_human_readable_logic_template: Cloudrail will review your AWS account password policy. {} This rule will only run if there is at least one user defined with direct console access (not via SSO).

  - vpc_endpoint_exposure_name_template:
      Ensure VPC Endpoint for {} is enabled in all VPCs in use
  - vpc_endpoint_exposure_description_template:
      A best practice is to enforce the use of VPC Endpoints to avoid sending data destined to {0} through the internet.
      Cloudrail will identify misconfigurations by checking if VPC Endpoint Interfaces are in use or not,
      by reviewing that an endpoint exists in the VPC.
      VPC Interface Endpoints might not be available in all regions,
      so the rule checks that if the service is running it's configured in all possible VPCs.
      This rule has potential false positives given that not all VPCs require communication with {0}.
  - vpc_endpoint_exposure_human_readable_logic_template:
      For each region, Cloudrail will verify if at least one {0} {1} exists,
      then will also verify that the service VPC Endpoint for {0} is available in the region,
      if so it will check that it's configured in all possible VPCs and will flag any non-compliant VPC.
  - vpc_endpoint_exposure_remediation_steps_console_template:
      Create a VPC Endpoint for {}, follow the guide at
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint>.
  - vpc_endpoint_exposure_remediation_steps_tf_template:
      Create a resource aws_vpc_endpoint for {} interface, and associate it to the VPC.

  - vpc_endpoint_subnet_exposure_name_template:
      Ensure VPC Endpoint for {} is enabled in all Availability Zones in use a VPC
  - vpc_endpoint_subnet_exposure_description_template:
      A best practice is to enforce the use of VPC Endpoints to avoid sending data destined to {0} through the internet.
      Cloudrail will identify misconfigurations by checking if VPC Endpoint Interfaces are in use or not,
      by reviewing that an endpoint exists in the VPC.
      VPC Interface Endpoints are not available in all availability zones,
      also they can be configured in just one subnet per availability zone,
      so the rule checks that if the service is running it's configured in at least two availability zones in use
      and leaves the traffic architecture decision to the customer.
      Additionally, make sure that if the application is using the custom hostnames for the service,
      and if it's using default hostnames (I.e. {1}.us-east-2.amazonaws.com) that
      the application is using Amazon DNS and not an internal DNS.
  - vpc_endpoint_subnet_exposure_human_readable_logic_template:
      For each region, Cloudrail will verify if at least one {0} {1} exists,
      then will also verify that the service VPC Endpoint for {0} is available in the region and
      in which availability zones. It will also check all subnets in use,
      and check all subnets that may have an endpoint configured.
      It will then check to see that at least two of the availability zones in use have an interface endpoint in them.
  - vpc_endpoint_subnet_exposure_remediation_steps_console_template:
      For each VPC that is currently using VPC endpoints for {}, make sure it’s enabled in one subnet for each
      Availability Zone in use. Follow the guide at
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint>.
      Interface endpoints do have their costs, so if that’s an issue, consider using at least two interface endpoints in
      different availability zones, and not just one.
  - vpc_endpoint_subnet_exposure_remediation_steps_tf_template:
      Locate resource aws_vpc_endpoint for {} interface, and make sure that argument subnet_ids contains at least one
      subnet in each Availability Zone in use. Interface endpoints do have their costs, so if that’s an issue,
      consider using at least two interface endpoints in different availability zones, and not just one.
  - not_car_access_analyzer_validation_name_template:
      Ensure IAM policies pass Access Analyzer policy validation without {0} and {1} issues
  - not_car_access_analyzer_validation_description_template:
      Cloudrail will send all of your IAM policies to the AWS Access Analyzer for Policy Validation.
      Any issues found by Access Analyzer at the {0} and {1} severities will be highlighted as issues by Cloudrail under this rule.
  - not_car_access_analyzer_validation_human_readable_logic_template:
      Cloudrail will identify all IAM policies in your Terraform plan and send them to the Access Analyzer
      policy validation API. Any policies which are found to have "findings" rated {0} and {1} will be considered violating.
  - not_car_access_analyzer_validation_remediation_steps_template: Review the findings and correct them within the policy.

    roles
  severity: major
  description: Having the same IAM role for both public and private instances may
    be dangerous. Someone may expand the permissions for the role in order to use
    it in a private workload, not realizing a public workload has the same privileges.
  human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will iterate over all EC2 resources that use IAM
    roles. It will classify them between "public" (those that are accessible from
    the Internet) and "private" (those that are not). If an IAM role is determined
    to be associated with at least one public instance and at least one private instance,
    it will be considered in violation.
  remediation_steps_console: Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create.html>
    to create an additional IAM role with an IAM role policy attached. Associate this
    role to the public EC2 instances.
  remediation_steps_tf: Create an additional aws_iam_role resource with an aws_iam_role_policy
    attached. Associate this role to the public EC2 instances using an aws_iam_instance_profile
    resource.

  name: VPC's in Transit Gateway should not have common CIDR's
  severity: medium
  description: It is important that VPCs utilizing a Transit Gateway should not have
    overlapping CIDR. This becomes problematic overtime as the VPCs will likely experience
    routing issues.
  human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will look at all of your Transit Gateways. For each
    one, it will determine which VPCs are in use. It will iterate over all VPCs in
    pairs and compare their CIDR blocks. If there's an intersection in the CIDR blocks
    (one contains an IP that is contained in the other) a violation will be flagged.
  remediation_steps_console: Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/working-with-vpcs.html>
    to specify a VPC CIDR block that is not overlapping with other VPC CIDRs using
    the Transit Gateway.
  remediation_steps_tf: For the aws_vpc resource, set cidr_block argument to use a
    CIDR block that is not overlapping with other VPC CIDRs using the Transit Gateway.

  severity: medium
  description: Using default security groups in general is inadvisable. By locking
    security groups down, you are validating that if anyone uses them by accident,
    they will realize before any security issues occur.
  human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will review all of the default security groups configured
    in your environment. It will then cross reference these security groups with the
    resources they are used with, to determine they are used at all. For each of those
    default security groups that are used, Cloudrail will determine if they allow
    any ingress or egress traffic. By doing this context-based analysis, Cloudrail
    ensures that only default security groups who pose a true security risk are highlighted.
  remediation_steps_console: Follow the guide at <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#deleting-security-group-rule>

  human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will identify all security groups in use. For each
    one, it will determine if all ports range are exposed to 0.0.0.0/0. Then, it will
    identify where the security group is in use. If it's not in use, the security
    group will be ignored. For each resource the security group is used with, Cloudrail
    will determine the subnet it is located in. It will then review the routing table
    to verify that the subnet is accessible from the Internet, and that the NACL associated
    with the subnet has all ports opened. This ensures the security group is only
    flagged if there's a real exposure.
